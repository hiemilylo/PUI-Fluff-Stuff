# PUI Assignment 5
## About
This repository holds the code that makes up my submission for CMU's course Programming Usable Interfaces, Assignment 5. We were tasked with using HTML / CSS / JavaScript to build a functional prototype of designs created in previous assignments.

## Extra Credit
For extra credit, we had the option to implement optional features. I implemented two tabs that were not required:
* Product Detail tab in the product description page
* Reviews tab in the product description page
